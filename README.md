## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

  I had challenges in terms of learning how to use XCode. I never used this application before and I was completely lost until
  I found videos online. Furthermore, it took me awhile to get used to Swift's syntax. I had the greatest difficulty trying
  to find the right allignment so that my app works for all devices.
